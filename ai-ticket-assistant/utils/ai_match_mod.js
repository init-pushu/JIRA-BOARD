- A list of skills required for a ticket.

1. Analyze which moderator's skill set best matches the required ticket skills.
2. Consider both direct overlap and semantic similarity (e.g., "Linux" matches "Operating Systems").
3. Weigh how well-rounded and relevant each moderator is.

Respond ONLY with the *email address* of the most suitable moderator â€” no explanations or formatting.`,
